# Google chrome extension: Jira ticket rank
The extension simply displays rank for each Jira ticket in the list. Useful when you want to prioritize stories based on linked requirements rank.

# Try out:
1. Enumerate & Save tickets - simple add the rank to the tickets, and save it.
2. Apply enumeration - after user "Enumerate & Save tickets" click on it, it's save the rank for the whole list, next user can apply some filters to the list and after clicks "Apply enumeration", will sets the rank to the tickets from the first list (before the filters)
